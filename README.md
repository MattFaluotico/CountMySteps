# Walkitout

**Released to the app store! This is still a beta test**

**When iOS 8 comes out, expect a new and imporoved version!** Check out the iOS 8 branch for progress. 

**This is some really messy code. As it was a learning process, some things are not done in the most efficient form. I plan on going back to polish and increase performance after the core features have been added**

Walk **it** out is a simplistic pedometer for the iPhone 5S. Using the built in M7 motion chip, motion data for the past 7 days is stored on the device. This application reads the data and interprets it into steps, miles, and calories. 



Stores the users height, weight, and gender to report the steps walked, miles walked, and calories lost per day. 

Uses the built in [CMMotionActivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreMotion/Reference/CMMotionActivityManager_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013503). 
Currently working on an open source wrapper to make CMMotion easier to use.
